`@prostojs/palitra` is a powerful color manipulation library that generates perceptually uniform color shades based on the Oklab color model.

## Features

- **Automating Shade Generation**: Automatically generates color shades from dark to light with visually equal perceptual steps.
- **Supporting Vivid Mode**: Enhances saturation and can adjust hues towards the nearest brighter or darker color at the edges of the shade array to increase color vividness.
- **Using Perceptual Uniformity**: Utilizes the Oklab color model to ensure colors are perceived uniformly in their brightness.
- **Colors with Suffixes**: Automatically generates palette with color names and suffixes like `blue-50`, `blue-100`, ..., `blue-900`.
