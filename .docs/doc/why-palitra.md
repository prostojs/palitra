# Why Palitra?

When I was working on the color scheme for my web project, I spent a lot of time flipping through design books and articles. Most of them seemed to agree on one thing: picking the right colors for a palette is more art than science. You pretty much have to trust your gut and "eyeball" each shade to make sure it looks right, which sounded super subjective and a bit hit-or-miss to me.

That got me thinking â€” could there be a more systematic way to do this? Why not challenge the status quo and see if there's a method to the madness? So, I started digging into different color palettes, looking for any patterns or rules that could be coded. That's how @prostojs/palitra was born.

This library is all about taking the guesswork out of making color palettes. It uses the Oklab color model to ensure the colors you pick are not only beautiful but look consistently good across different lighting and backgrounds. Plus, it has a cool feature that lets you amp up the vividness of colors, making your designs pop just the right amount. Think of it as a little bit of math magic to boost your creative flair!
